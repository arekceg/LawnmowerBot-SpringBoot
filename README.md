# LawnmowerBot-SpringBoot
LawnmowerBot rewritten in SpringBoot
https://www.facebook.com/lawnmowerbot1

Simple facebook bot built with RestFB. Hosted on GCP.

The idea came to me when, by some weird ad-targeting mischief, I was bombarded with land mower ads and realized that they all look like they had distinct personalities. I thought it would be fun to assign them names, nicknames and therefore - a character.

**For this bot to work TOKEN and PAGEID_LAWN enviromental variables must be added to the system running it.**
